# Firefox attempts to put all windows back where they used to be, but it fails miserably at this. The result is that the
# windows are spread out over all workspaces (even ones that didn't even have firefox instances in the first place),
# making putting them all where they belong a hassle. This script moves them all to one workspace (14), which makes
# sorting them manually less painful.
